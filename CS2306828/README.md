Hi Jonathan, Philip informed me of your update. Could you clarify what you meant by not being able to sign the form? Are you having trouble downloading it or did you mean something else? We have received approval from our GTC team, but our Legal team needs the signed form to to finalize their side of the approval. Once that's complete we can schedule the pickup. Thank you, Rosario C Site Manager, TOR01 IBM Cloud

Once it is packed and ready to go, the customer may have the device at no cost. However, the device must be picked up at the data center by the person listed as the administrator on the account. And that person must sign the Acknowledgement of Receipt provided to data center personnel. This Acknowledgement of Receipt states "I acknowledge receipt, on behalf of SIPSTACK, Inc. ("Customer"), of the Hardware described in the attached "Exhibit A." I represent and warrant that I am authorized to execute this Acknowledgement of Receipt on behalf of Customer."

Jonathan Geller 2021-05-28 14:52:38

Please provide us with: 1. the address of the location at which the drive can be picked up; 2. all of the documentation required to be signed by Sipstack’s representative in order to enable the drive to be released; and 3. confirmation that nothing else needs to be done or provided in order to receive the drive.”

Hi Jonathan, Thanks for your patience. 1. The address of our location is: 371 Gough Rd, Markham, ON L3R 4B6 2. The attached Acknowledgement of Receipt form is all you'll need to fill out.
