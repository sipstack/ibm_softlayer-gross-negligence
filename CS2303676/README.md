Greetings, Your server is down referencing ticket CS2301154. I'm escalating this over to hardware as Lenovo IPMI is showing system board failure. System Board Sensor SysBrd Vol Fault has transitioned to critical from a less severe state. Thank you, Ricardo C Compute Support Engineer IBM Cloud Support

Is this response helpful?

Is there any reason there has been no response to PVE02 new order still incomplete? Or that our VPN to our management consoles are also not working. This is a major risk. Please advise!
